## 0x0F. C - Function pointers



# Pointers to functions
A useful technique is the ability to have pointers to functions. Their declaration is easy: write the declaration as it would be for the function, say

int func(int a, float b);
and simply put brackets around the name and a * in front of it: that declares the pointer. Because of precedence, if you don't parenthesize the name, you declare a function returning a pointer:

/* function returning pointer to int */
int *func(int a, float b);

/* pointer to function returning int */
int (*func)(int a, float b);
