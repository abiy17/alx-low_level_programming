## 0x13. C - More singly linked lists

### linked list
 is a data structure that consists of a series of nodes, each of which contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next node in the list. Linked lists are a versatile data structure that can be used to implement a variety of different data structures, such as stacks, queues, and trees.
In C, linked lists are typically implemented using structs. A struct is a user-defined data type that can be used to create custom data types. The struct for a linked list node would typically contain two members: one for the data and one for the pointer to the next node.
